Create a single web page that is a sending postcards to future “Postcards 2 The Future”. 
The tags I want to have on my website are (header, main, nav, section, article, aside, footer).
I want to have a logo in the header section of my page, but I also want this logo to be in the footer section.
Page gallery has a Grid Container consists of grid items arranged in columns and rows. Columns: 2 Rows:4. Each one of the gallery images into each container.

When user click on the gallery images with the cursor, pop-up opens and allow the user to write a message.

Pop-up message
With this website users can contribute digital postcards with their messages. The content is then sealed and opened at a later date so users can read the message from past. 
Pop up section has 5 lines and 1 action button.
Line1 - Full Name
Line 2 - Subject
Line 3 - Recipient’s mail
Line 4 - Capsuled Time
Line 5 - Message
Message line allow 200 characters long.
Action button is using mailto action. Button on click display text is “Send” When the button is clicked the e-mail send to recipient’s e-mail, using Line 1-2-3-4 to send an e-mail.


Add a link to footer: "Contact us" This should be a pop-up link. 
Pop up link has 3 lines and 1 action button.
